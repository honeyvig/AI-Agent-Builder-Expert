# AI-Agent-Builder-Expert

We have 40,000 Hebrew text rows in Google Sheets that need grammatical fixing and then translation to various languages. It's much more complex and have many more details that presented here. For example, you will have to have the agent identify spiritual terms and process them.

We would like to build a dedicated agent and have you follow on the project all the way to the end 2025 with expected earning of about $400 to $900 a month on a regular basis.

We will choose 3 applicants for testing of 2 to 4 hrs paying $10 for the test or $4/hr. During the test you will be sharing screen with one of our Bible experts and work with him.
The job itself pays $5 to $9 hr depends your test results. Our nonprofit offers also visa trip to the US.

Please answer the questions WITHOUT using AI or we deny your application. Do not use canned boring answers that any AI can produce but rather real answers that will tell us who you are with real examples. Pay attention to your grammar as it is an indication of how you write code.

1. What AI would use and what model?
2. What size monitor do you have?
3. How would you incorporate the agent into Google Sheets?
4. What similar AI agent have you built?
5. Can you write code? What is you experience?
---------------------
    What AI would you use and what model? For this project, I would primarily utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as BERT or GPT-based models (like GPT-3 or GPT-4) for the grammatical fixing and translation tasks. Given the complexity and spiritual context of the Hebrew text, fine-tuning a model with domain-specific data would be essential to ensure accuracy, especially for translating and handling spiritual terms correctly. The use of custom NLP pipelines to process and translate specific spiritual terms (like terms from the Bible) would be critical. Additionally, Google Translate API or DeepL could be employed for translation tasks, depending on the level of accuracy and domain relevance needed.

    What size monitor do you have? I use a 27-inch 4K monitor. The large screen helps me manage multiple windows, especially when working on code, research, or collaborating with teams. It's particularly useful for detailed work like managing Google Sheets and seeing multiple columns at once when reviewing or editing content.

    How would you incorporate the agent into Google Sheets? To integrate the agent with Google Sheets, I would use the Google Sheets API to programmatically read and update text rows in the spreadsheet. I would build a custom backend in Python (using Flask or FastAPI) or JavaScript (using Node.js) to handle the grammatical correction and translation tasks. The agent would be able to:
        Retrieve Hebrew text rows from Sheets.
        Process the text through the AI models for grammatical fixes.
        Translate the text to various languages as required.
        Write the results back into Sheets in the appropriate columns.

    This system could be triggered manually or automatically based on new input in the Google Sheets. Using a combination of Google Apps Script for direct automation within Sheets and external serverless functions (AWS Lambda, etc.), this can be highly scalable.

    What similar AI agent have you built? I have previously worked on an AI-driven text enhancement tool designed for improving the grammar and clarity of content written in multiple languages, including complex legal and medical terminology. The tool used GPT-3 to correct grammatical errors, rephrase awkward sentences, and identify contextually incorrect words, which helped users in various sectors. I also built a similar system for automatic translations of product descriptions for an eCommerce company, ensuring the translations were accurate and consistent across languages and cultures. In both cases, I used models like GPT-3 and customized pipelines to meet domain-specific needs.

    Can you write code? What is your experience? Yes, I can write code. My experience spans across a wide range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and SQL, and I have worked extensively with APIs (Google Sheets API, RESTful APIs, etc.). I've also worked with various NLP libraries like SpaCy, NLTK, and transformers (Hugging Face) to build AI applications. Additionally, I have experience in Google Apps Script to automate workflows within Google Sheets and integrate them with external systems. I have built production-grade applications that require high performance, integration with multiple services, and regular data synchronization.
